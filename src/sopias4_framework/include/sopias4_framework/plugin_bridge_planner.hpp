    /**
     * @class PlannerBridge
     * @brief A plugin bridge that allows to write Nav2 planner plugins in another programming language than C++
     *
     * This class shouldn't need any modification if you plan to use the plugin bridge. However, if you plan to write your own
     * C++ plugin without this bridge, then this documentation and code can be taken as a refernce (additionally the official documentation
     * at https://navigation.ros.org/plugin_tutorials/docs/writing_new_nav2planner_plugin.html is good).
     *
     * If you plan to use this Plugin bridge, then you have to do the following steps:
     *      1. Configure your Navigation 2 configuration to use this bridge as an planner:
     *            \code{.yaml}
     *             planner_server:
                        ros__parameters:
                            plugins: ["GridBased"]
                            GridBased:
                                plugin: "plugin_bridges/PlannerBridge"
                                plugin_name: "Astar"
                                save_costmaps: True
                                save_path: "/home/ws/"
     *             \endcode
     *      2. Implement a ROS2 service which has to fulfill following things:
     *          - The service name must be /<namespace>/<plugin_name>/create_plan (Reminder: ROS applies namespace automatically to service name if node is launched in corresponding namespace)
     *          - The service must return a nav_msgs/Path instance where the planned path is given back as an response. Look at service definition sopias4_msgs/drv/CreatePlan.srv
     *          - If using Python: The PlannerPyPlugin class from this framework does this already under the hood, so you can inherit from this class
     *          - A service can be implemented in any programming language, as long as following conditions are met:
     *              - There must be a ROS2 client library available, installed and running
     *              - The ROS2 client library must be able to do: Running a node, running a service, generate service classes from service definitons
     *              - https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Client-Libraries.html lists a set of known client libraries and languages
     *          - Make sure that the node which serves your service is running
